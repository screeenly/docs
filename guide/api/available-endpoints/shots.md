# Shots (Screenshots and PDFs)

The `/api/v1/shots` API endpoints allows you to generate screenshots or PDFs of a given URL or HTML snippet. You can find a detailed list of all available parameters in the [API reference](/reference/#tag/shots).

## Create a screenshot from URL

The most basic payload to create a screenshot of a URL looks like this.

```json

}
```

The resulting JSON response will contain a URL to download the screenshot or PDF, as well as the expiration date of the generated file. The meta section contains information about your current usage and limits.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random",
        "expires_at": "2024-06-28T19:20:50+00:00",
        "screenshot_url": "https://3.screeenly.com/storage/153449/3e23f899-ba17-44ac-a089-48382db7fc7c.jpg"
    },

        }
    }
}
```
